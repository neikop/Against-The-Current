      Map Editor for Ancient Empires 2
      --------------------------------


Sorry I'm too lazy to write -_-
So, briefly:



Buttons:
-------

[Load] load a map

[Save] save a map

[New] create a new map (size between 10x1 to 22x22)

[Basic water draw] draw automatically the water/ground borders (basic).

[Basic road draw] draw automatically roads direction (basic).

[Check] Check the map for known mistakes and report to a temporary log file.

[Run] Send the actual map shown in the editor (no need to be saved) to a batch file to test it quickly with a emulator.
      (You could need the pack: testmap.zip, normally can be found at http://byblo.proboards.com/index.cgi#ae2)
      Note: if the map's name is not m+numeric (m0, m7, m12,...), it will be send to the batch ALWAYS as: s0 (first skirmish map in the list)



Mouse click list:
----------------
{left click on the map} paste the selected tiles/unit shown on the selection box.
{right click on the map} set the selected tile to the selection box on the world edition mode, remove an unit for the unit edition mode.

{left click on selection box} backward rotation color/2d rotation (and by type if world edition mode)
{right click on selection box} forward rotation color/2d rotation (and by type if world edition mode)

And so on...



Note:
----
* Do not forget to associate the extension .ae2 to the map editor.
This will permit you to open a map by simply clicking on its file and also allowing multi editions.

* Please share your creations (after checking it), do not keep your work isolated : http://byblo.proboards.com/index.cgi#ae2
  You can also send them to me at byblo@hotmail.com (with a explicit object line, AE2 MAPS or something...),
